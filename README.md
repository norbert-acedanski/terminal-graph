### Working with graph-data:
1. Change _timeSpan_ to the number of samples you input.
2. Change _timeDifference_, _graphValue_ and _unit_ accordingly to the data you input.
3. Input data values to the program.
4. Compile and run the program.
5. Data should be printed in the terminal.

Back in the days, I used it as a custom way of displaying data in the terminal (mostly weight in following days or weeks).
